# Reporting Security Issues

Please report security issues to security@gramineproject.io.

Please note that the Gramine team analyzes security bugs only on the current
`master` branch. This implies that you must reproduce the bug on master before
reporting.

The Gramine team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your
report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you
informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

If the bug report is correct, we will acknowledge your contributions by
specifying your name in the commit message. Please provide the preferred
name/nick to put there.
