Procedure for adding and removing maintainers
---------------------------------------------

+ Joining: # of PRs submitted & merged + # of PRs reviewed + # of issues closed
  >= 20 (this means that a PR which fixes 3 issues counts as 4). Only complete
  and thorough reviews count.
+ Leaving: a member may be removed if not active or notoriously breaking rules
  from this document.
+ Additionally, at least 60% (rounded up) of current members have to agree to
  make any change to the team membership.
