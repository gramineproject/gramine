Introduction to SGX
===================

.. highlight:: sh

The Gramine project uses the :term:`Intel SGX <SGX>` (Software Guard Extensions)
technology to protect software running on untrusted hosts. SGX is a |~|
complicated topic, which may be hard to learn, because the documentation is
scattered through official/reference documentation, blogposts and academic
papers. This page is an attempt to curate a |~| dossier of available reading
material.

SGX is an umbrella name of *technology* that comprises several parts:

- CPU/platform *hardware features*: the instruction set, microarchitecture with
  the :term:`PRM` memory region and some new MSRs, some new logic in the MMU
  and so on;
- the SGX :term:`Remote Attestation` *infrastructure*, online services provided
  by Intel and/or third parties (see :term:`DCAP`);
- :term:`SDK` and assorted *software*.

SGX is still being developed. The current (March 2024) version of CPU features
is referred to as ":term:`SGX2`" or simply "SGX". The older instruction set
from the original SGX is informally referred to as ":term:`SGX1`".

Features which might be considered part of SGX2:

- :term:`EDMM` (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management)
- :term:`FLC` (Flexible Launch Control; not strictly part of SGX2, but was not
  part of original SGX hardware either)
- :term:`KSS` (Key Separation and Sharing; also not part of SGX2, but was not
  part of original SGX hardware either)

Around 2022 Intel discontinued SGX support in client CPU cores, and instead
introduced it to server cores. The new SGX hardware architecture didn't change
the user-facing ABI, but loosened security guarantees, matching AMD SEV-SNP
security model:

- Merkle tree for memory integrity checking was removed.
- Hardware RAM MitM attacks are not mitigated anymore: (because of Merkle tree
  removal)

  - On Icelake server CPUs there's no integrity protection at all.
  - On Sapphire Rapids server CPUs there's a 28-bit MAC per each cacheline.
    It's possible to bruteforce the MAC or do a replay attack with cacheline
    granularity (but that still requires a hardware MitM).

- EPC can now be almost arbitrarily big, significantly improving performance for
  large workloads.

As of now most of the broadly used server CPUs support :term:`SGX2`. Only older
client CPUs support SGX, so they should not be used in production (because of
missing security patches for side-channels).

Linux kernel drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For historical reasons, there are three SGX drivers currently (March 2024):

- https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver -- old one, does not support DCAP,
  deprecated

- https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver
  -- out-of-tree, supports both non-DCAP software infrastructure (with old EPID
  remote-attestation technique) and the new DCAP (with new ECDSA and
  more "normal" PKI infrastructure). Deprecated in favor of the upstreamed
  driver (see below).

- The upstreamed Linux driver -- SGX support was upstreamed to the Linux
  mainline starting from 5.11. It currently supports only DCAP attestation.

  Also, it doesn't require :term:`IAS` and kernel maintainers consider
  non-writable :term:`FLC` MSRs as non-functional SGX:

SGX terminology
---------------

.. keep this sorted by full (not abbreviated) terms, leaving out generic terms
   like "Intel" and "SGX"

.. glossary::

   Architectural Enclaves
   AE

      Architectural Enclaves (AEs) are a |~| set of "system" enclaves concerned
      with starting and attesting other enclaves. Intel provides reference
      implementations of these enclaves, though other companies may write their
      own implementations.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`Provisioning Enclave`

         :term:`Launch Enclave`

         :term:`Quoting Enclave`

   Architectural Enclave Service Manager
   AESM

      The Architectural Enclave Service Manager is responsible for providing SGX
      applications with access to the :term:`Architectural Enclaves`. It consists
      of the Architectural Enclave Service Manager Daemon, which hosts the enclaves,
      and a component of the SGX SDK, which communicates with the daemon over a Unix
      socket with the fixed path :file:`/var/run/aesmd/aesm.sock`.

   Asynchronous Enclave Exit
   AEX

      An event caused by an exception occurring during in-enclave execution. CPU
      saves the current context into :term:`SSA`, leaves SGX mode and jumps
      to :term:`AEP`.

   Asynchronous Exit Pointer
   AEP

      An address outside the enclave where CPU will jump in case an exception
      happens during in-enclave execution.

   Attestation

      Attestation is a mechanism to prove the trustworthiness of the SGX enclave
      to a local or remote party. More specifically, SGX attestation proves that
      the enclave runs on a real hardware in an up-to-date TEE with the expected
      initial state. There are two types of the attestation:
      :term:`Local Attestation` (between enclaves on the same machines)
      and :term:`Remote Attestation` (between enclave and any party, possibly
      remote).

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`attestation`

         :term:`Local Attestation`

         :term:`Remote Attestation`

   Data Center Attestation Primitives
   DCAP

      A |~| software infrastructure provided by Intel as a reference
      implementation for the new ECDSA/:term:`PCS`-based remote attestation.
      Relies on the :term:`Flexible Launch Control` hardware feature.

      This allows for launching enclaves with Intel's remote infrastructure
      only involved in the initial setup. Naturally however, this requires
      deployment of own infrastructure, so is operationally more complicated.
      Therefore it is intended for server environments (where you control all
      the machines).

      .. seealso::

         Orientation Guide
            https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/docs/DCAP_ECDSA_Orientation.pdf

         :term:`EPID`
            A |~| way to launch enclaves with Intel's infrastructure, intended
            for client machines.

   ECALL

      A |~| special function call made by non-enclave world into an enclave.

   Enclave

      An instance of SGX TEE, residing in a contiguous chunk of usermode address
      space (``ELRANGE``) of some process on the system. Application threads
      may enter and exit the enclave through dedicated CPU instructions. Code
      running inside an enclave has access to usermode memory of the process
      which contains it, but not the other way.

   Enclave Dynamic Memory Management
   EDMM

      A |~| hardware feature of :term:`SGX2`, allows for dynamic (in enclave
      runtime) addition and removal of enclave threads and memory, as well as
      changing memory permissions and type.

   Enclave Page Cache
   EPC

      A |~| part of :term:`PRM` used for caching enclave pages. :term:`EPC` is
      only an optimization and its size doesn't limit possible enclave sizes,
      though too-small :term:`EPC` may lead to frequent page swapping and
      significantly worsen performance.

   Enclave Page Cache Map
   EPCM

      A |~| part of :term:`PRM` which holds metadata about EPC pages.

   Enhanced Privacy Identification
   Enhanced Privacy Identifier
   EPID

      EPID is the attestation protocol originally shipped with SGX. Unlike
      :term:`DCAP`, a |~| remote verifier making use of the EPID protocol needs
      to contact the :term:`Intel Attestation Service` each time it wishes
      to attest an |~| enclave.

      Contrary to DCAP, EPID may be understood as "opinionated", with most
      moving parts fixed and tied to services provided by Intel. This is
      intended for client enclaves and deprecated for server environments.

      EPID attestation can operate in two modes: *fully-anonymous (unlinkable)
      quotes* and *pseudonymous (linkable) quotes*.  Unlike fully-anonymous
      quotes, pseudonymous quotes include an |~| identifier dependent on the
      identity of the CPU and the developer of the enclave being quoted, which
      allows determining whether two instances of your enclave are running on
      the same CPU or not.

      If your security model depends on enforcing that the identifiers are
      different (e.g. because you want to prevent sybil attacks), keep in mind
      that the enclave host can generate a new identity by performing an
      epoch reset. The previous identity will then become inaccessible, though.

      The attestation mode being used can be chosen by the application enclave,
      but it must match what was chosen when generating the :term:`SPID`.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`DCAP`
            A way to launch enclaves without relying on the Intel's
            infrastructure (after initial setup).

         :term:`SPID`
            An identifier one can obtain from Intel, required to make use of EPID
            attestation.

   Flexible Launch Control
   FLC

      Hardware (CPU) feature that allows substituting :term:`Launch Enclave` for
      one not signed by Intel through a |~| change in SGX's EINIT logic to not
      require the EINITTOKEN from the Intel-based Launch Enclave. An |~| MSR,
      which can be locked at boot time, keeps the hash of the public key of
      the "launching" entity.

      With FLC, :term:`Launch Enclave` can be written by other companies (other
      than Intel) and must be signed with the key corresponding to the one
      locked in the MSR (a |~| reference Launch Enclave simply allows all
      enclaves to run). The MSR can also stay unlocked and then it can be
      modified at run-time by the VMM or the OS kernel.

      Support for FLC can be detected using ``CPUID`` instruction, as
      ``CPUID.07H:ECX.SGX_LC[bit 30] == 1`` (SDM vol. 2A calls this "SGX Launch
      Control").

            Announcement

         :term:`DCAP`

   Key Separation and Sharing
   KSS
      A feature that lets developer define additional enclave identity
      attributes and configuration identifier. Extended enclave identity
      is defined by the developer on enclave build. Enclave configuration is
      defined on enclave launch and cannot be modified afterwards.

      In addition to the calculated enclave and signer measurements, developer
      is expected to define a product ID and :term:`SVN` for her enclaves.
      These identifiers are part of the :term:`SGX Report` and are expected to
      be used in :term:`Attestation`. They are also used by SGX key derivation
      to derive different keys per configuration.

      KSS adds two more attributes for enclave build and two new ones for
      enclave launch, which are part of the :term:`SGX Report`.
      Additionally, key policy attributes are extended to provide fine-grained
      control over key derivation.

      New build attributes:

      - Extended product ID
      - Family ID

      New enclave launch attributes:

      - Config ID
      - Config SVN

      This feature was not part of original SGX and therefore is not supported
      by all SGX-enabled hardware.

   Local Attestation

      In local attestation, the attesting SGX enclave collects attestation
      evidence in the form of an :term:`SGX Report` using the EREPORT hardware
      instruction. This form of attestation is used to send the attestation
      evidence to a local party (on the same physical machine).

   Intel Attestation Service
   IAS

      Internet service provided by Intel for "old" :term:`EPID`-based remote
      attestation. Enclaves send SGX quotes to the client/verifier who will
      forward them to IAS to check their validity.

      .. seealso::

   PSW

      Software infrastructure provided by Intel with all special
      :term:`Architectural Enclaves` (:term:`Provisioning Enclave`,
      :term:`Quoting Enclave`, :term:`Launch Enclave`). This mainly refers to
      the "old" EPID/IAS-based remote attestation.

   Processor Reserved Memory
   PRM

      A |~| mostly undocumented region of physical address space reserved by the
      BIOS for internal use by SGX hardware. Known to contain at
      least :term:`EPC` and :term:`EPCM`.

   Provisioning Enclave
   PE

      One of the Architectural Enclaves of the Intel SGX software
      infrastructure. It is part of the :term:`SGX Platform Software`. The
      Provisioning Enclave is used in :term:`EPID` based remote attestation.
      This enclave communicates with the Intel Provisioning Service
      (:term:`IPS`) to perform EPID provisioning. The result of this
      provisioning procedure is the private EPID key securely accessed by the
      Provisioning Enclave. This procedure happens only during the first
      deployment of the SGX machine (or, in rare cases, to provision a new EPID
      key after TCB upgrade). The main user of the Provisioning Enclave is the
      :term:`Quoting Enclave`.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`Architectural Enclaves`

   Provisioning Certification Enclave
   PCE

      One of the Architectural Enclaves of the Intel SGX software
      infrastructure. It is part of the :term:`SGX Platform Software` and
      :term:`DCAP`. The Provisioning Certification Enclave is used in
      :term:`DCAP` based remote attestation.  This enclave communicates with the
      Intel Provisioning Certification Service (:term:`PCS`) to perform DCAP
      provisioning. The result of this provisioning procedure is the DCAP/ECDSA
      attestation collateral (mainly the X.509 certificate chains rooted in a
      well-known Intel certificate and Certificate Revocation Lists). This
      procedure happens during the first deployment of the SGX machine and then
      periodically to refresh the cached attestation collateral. Typically, to
      reduce the dependency on PCS, a cloud service provider introduces an
      intermediate caching service (Provisioning Certification Caching Service,
      or PCCS) that stores all the attestation collateral obtained from Intel.
      The main user of the Provisioning Certification Enclave is the
      :term:`Quoting Enclave`.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`Architectural Enclaves`

   Intel Provisioning Service
   IPS

      Internet service provided by Intel for EPID-based remote attestation.
      This service provides the corresponding EPID key to the Provisioning
      Enclave on a remote SGX machine.

   Intel Provisioning Certification Service
   PCS

      New internet service provided by Intel for new ECDSA-based remote
      attestation. Enclave provider creates its own internal Attestation Service
      where it caches PKI collateral from Intel's PCS, and the verifier gets the
      certificate chain from the enclave provider to check validity.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`IAS`
            Intel Attestation Service, another Internet service.

   Quoting Enclave
   QE

      One of the Architectural Enclaves of the Intel SGX software
      infrastructure. It is part of the :term:`SGX Platform Software`. The
      Quoting Enclave receives an :term:`SGX Report` and produces a
      corresponding :term:`SGX Quote`. The identity of the Quoting Enclave is
      publicly known (it signer, its measurement and its attributes) and is
      vetted by public companies such as Intel (in the form of the certificate
      chain ending in a publicly known root certificate of the company).

      .. seealso::

         :term:`Architectural Enclaves`

   Remote Attestation

      For remote attestation, the attesting SGX enclave collects attestation
      evidence in the form of an :term:`SGX Quote` using the :term:`Quoting
      Enclave` (and the :term:`Provisioning Enclave` if required). The enclave
      then may send the collected attestation evidence to the local or remote
      party, which will verify the evidence and confirm the authenticity and
      integrity of the attested enclave. After this, the local or remote party
      trusts the enclave and may establish a secure channel with the enclave
      and send secrets to it.

   SGX Quote

      The SGX quote is the proof of trustworthiness of the enclave and is used
      during :term:`Remote Attestation`. The attesting enclave generates the
      enclave-specific :term:`SGX Report`, sends the request to the
      :term:`Quoting Enclave` using :term:`Local Attestation`, and the Quoting
      Enclave returns back the SGX quote with the SGX report embedded in it. The
      resulting SGX quote contains the enclave's measurement, attributes and
      other security-relevant fields, and is tied to the identity of the
      :term:`Quoting Enclave` to prove its authenticity. The obtained SGX quote
      may be later sent to the verifying remote party, which examines the SGX
      quote and gains trust in the remote enclave.

   SGX Report

      The SGX report is a data structure that contains the enclave's measurement,
      signer identity, attributes and a user-defined 64B string. The SGX report
      is generated using the ``EREPORT`` hardware instruction. It is used during
      :term:`Local Attestation`. The SGX report is embedded into the
      :term:`SGX Quote`.

   SGX1

      The original SGX instruction set, without dynamic resource management.

   SGX2

      New SGX instructions and other hardware features that were introduced
      after the release of the original :term:`SGX1` (e.g. :term:`EDMM`).

   Service Provider ID
   SPID

      An identifier provided by Intel, used together with an |~| :term:`EPID`
      API key to authenticate to the :term:`Intel Attestation Service`. You can
      obtain an |~| SPID through Intel's `Trusted Services Portal
      <https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation>`_.

   Security Version Number
   SVN

      Each element of the SGX :term:`TCB` is assigned a Security Version Number
      (SVN). For the hardware, these SVNs are referred to collectively as
      CPU_SVN, and for software referred as ISV_SVN. A TCB is considered up to
      date if all components of the TCB have SVNs greater than or equal to a
      threshold published by the author of the component.

   Trusted Execution Environment
   TEE

      A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment where the code
      executed and the data accessed are isolated and protected in terms of
      confidentiality (no one has access to the data except the code running
      inside the TEE) and integrity (no one can change the code and its
      behavior).

   Trusted Computing Base
   TCB

      In context of :term:`SGX` this has the usual meaning: the set of all
      components that are critical to security. Any vulnerability in TCB
      compromises security. Any problem outside TCB is not a |~| vulnerability,
      i.e. |~| should not compromise security.

      In context of Gramine there is also a |~| different meaning
      (:term:`Thread Control Block`). Those two should not be confused.
