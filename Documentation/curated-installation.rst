Ready-made confidential protected images
======================================

Confidential Compute images with Gramine are ready-made solutions for popular open-source projects such as PyTorch and Redis. Customize your environment through Interactive scripts. The result is a curated, confidentially protected Gramine image that includes your specific machine-learning application, common dependencies, and a manifest file that specifies security policies to enforce for your workload.

.. note::
    These confidential compute images only run on machines that support Intel SGX.
