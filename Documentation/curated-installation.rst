Ready-made confidential protected images
========================================

Confidential Compute images with Gramine are ready-made solutions for popular
open-source projects such as PyTorch and Redis. Customize your environment
through Interactive scripts. The result is a curated, confidentially protected
Gramine image that includes your specific machine-learning application, common
dependencies, and a manifest file that specifies security policies to enforce
for your workload.

.. note::
    These confidential compute images only run on machines that support Intel
    SGX.
