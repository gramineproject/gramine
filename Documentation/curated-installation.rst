Confidential Compute images with Gramine are ready-made solutions for popular

Customize your environment through interactive scripts.
The result is a curated, confidentially protected Gramine image that includes
your specific machine-learning application, common dependencies, and a Gramine
manifest file that specifies security policies to enforce for your workload.
