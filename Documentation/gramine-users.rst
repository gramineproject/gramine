Users of Gramine
================

We are excited to share that several companies are experimenting with Gramine for their confidential computing solutions. Please reach out to us at maintainers@gramineproject.io if you are using Gramine and would like to be highlighted on our page. We are looking forward to collaborating with you and continue to enhance Gramine to meet the needs of your confidential computing use cases. We will be updating this list regularly (the list is sorted alphabetically).

- `Eder Labs <https://www.eder.io>`__ started its journey with the belief that businesses worldwide should easily be able to adopt ML/AI, without the concerns around compromising sensitive enterprise or consumer data. Towards this future, Eder Labs has begun facilitating exploratory data science between data users and data providers, for structured text data, and will be using the Gramine LibOS to facilitate training and deployment of models in a secure and federated manner, as the data science journey matures for these businesses. The Gramine ecosystem is laying the path to a more secure future, for all kinds of ML/AI applications, and Eder Labs is a firm supporter and beneficiary of this future-defining paradigm.

- `enclaive.io <https://enclaive.io>`__ uses among other technologies Gramine to
  generically enclavize applications. Enclaive builds and deploys confidential
  containers for the zero-trust Web. Use cases are in the area of GDPR-compliant
  Web analytics and AI. Specifically, Gramine Shielded Containers (GSC) ease the
  design of confidential containers.

- `JD Cloud <https://www.jdcloud.com/>`__ is experimenting with Gramine for
  several solutions.

  - `Super Protocol <https://www.superprotocol.com/>`__ combines the benefits of
  both Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology and blockchain to offer a
  universal, decentralized, confidential cloud computing platform. It enables
  easy deployment of a wide range of workloads - a rich ecosystem of
  interoperable solutions and services, including databases, web services,
  confidential data sources, and much more. Super Protocol takes advantage of
  the open-source Gramine library OS, which works in conjunction with Intel SGX
  to provide additional security benefits in Linux environments.

- `Tencent Cloud <https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/>`__ relies on Gramine to
  implement several SGX-based solutions by running unmodified Linux
  applications. One example is the recent launch of the Tencent Cloud
  Shuliantong product, announced at the Tencent Digital Ecosystem Summit.

- The national digital health agency `gematik <https://www.gematik.de/>`__ is
  responsible for the *ePrescription* project in Germany. `IBM
  <https://www.ibm.com/>`__ uses Gramine to implement the "VAU"-concept on SGX
  to ensure a maximum of privacy and request-context isolation. The VAU-concept
  is used for confidential computing in different implementations as well, such
  as the electronic health record.
