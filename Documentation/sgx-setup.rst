Set up the host environment
===========================

.. note ::
   Currently, Gramine has two backends: Linux (execution on the host Linux OS)
   and Linux-SGX (execution inside an SGX enclave). The Linux backend doesn't
   require any specific environment. Thus, this page describes how to set up the
   SGX environment on your platform.

Gramine with SGX support requires several features from your system:

- Intel SGX must be enabled in BIOS.
- Linux kernel version must be at least 5.11 (starting from this version, Linux
  has the FSGSBASE feature and the SGX driver required by Gramine).
- The Intel PSW must be installed.
- The Intel DCAP must be installed if DCAP-based attestation will be used.

If your system doesn't meet these requirements, please refer to more detailed
descriptions in :doc:`devel/building`.

Check for SGX compatibility
---------------------------

We supply a tool, :doc:`manpages/is-sgx-available` that checks the environment
for SGX compatibility. Use this tool to check your hardware and system. It is
installed together with the Gramine package.

Prepare a signing key
---------------------

Only for SGX, and if you haven't already, enter the following:

::

    gramine-sgx-gen-private-key

This command generates an RSA 3072 key suitable for signing SGX enclaves and
stores it in ``$HOME/.config/gramine/enclave-key.pem``. Protect this key and do
not disclose it to anyone. See also :doc:`manpages/gramine-sgx-gen-private-key`.

Signing an SGX enclave is a required step in Intel SGX. First, only signed
enclaves are allowed to be loaded on an SGX platform. Second, the enclave's
signed structure (so-called SIGSTRUCT) includes a measurement of the enclave
code (so-called MRENCLAVE), the derivative of the public key (so-called
MRSIGNER) and other metadata; thus, the process of enclave signing binds
together these measurements of the loaded enclave, and subsequent SGX
attestation can prove the genuineness of this enclave based on these
measurements.
