Debugging Gramine with GDB
==========================

.. highlight:: sh

Debugging without SGX support
-----------------------------

To enable GDB support, the PAL loader and Gramine implement the GDB protocol to
notify the debugger about any loading and unloading of dynamic libraries. The
PAL loader also loads a |~| GDB script to enable GDB features to make the
debugging process easier.

To build Gramine with debug symbols, the source code needs to be compiled with
``--buildtype=debug``::

    meson setup build-debug/ --werror --buildtype=debug -Ddirect=enabled
    ninja -C build-debug/
    sudo ninja -C build-debug/ install

To run Gramine with GDB, use the following command to run your application::

    GDB=1 gramine-direct [application] [arguments]

Debugging with SGX support
--------------------------

Gramine supports debugging of enclavized applications if the enclave is created
in debug mode. Gramine provides a specialized GDB for the application and the
library OS running inside an enclave (using a normal GDB will only debug the
execution *outside* the enclave).

To build Gramine with debug symbols, the source code needs to be compiled with
``--buildtype=debug``::

    meson setup build-debug/ --werror --buildtype=debug -Dsgx=enabled
    ninja -C build-debug/
    sudo ninja -C build-debug/ install

After rebuilding Gramine with debug symbols, you need to re-sign the manifest of
the application. For instance, if you want to debug the ``helloworld`` program,
run the following commands::

    cd CI-Examples/helloworld
    make SGX=1 clean
    make SGX=1 DEBUG=1

To run Gramine with GDB, use the Gramine loader (``gramine-sgx``) and specify
``GDB=1``::

    GDB=1 gramine-sgx [application] [arguments]

Compiling with optimizations enabled
------------------------------------

Building Gramine with ``--buildtype=debug`` enables debug symbols and GDB
integration but disables optimizations. This is usually the right thing to do:
optimized builds are harder to debug, as they may cause GDB to display confusing
tracebacks or garbage data.

However, in some cases an optimized debug build might be desirable: for example,
``_FORTIFY_SOURCE`` runtime checks work only when optimizations are enabled, and
profiling optimized code will give you more accurate results.

To build Gramine with debug symbols, and with optimizations still enabled, use
``--buildtype=debugoptimized``.
