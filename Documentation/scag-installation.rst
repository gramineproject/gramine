Scaffolding For Gramine
=======================

The Scaffolding for Gramine (SCAG) tool SCAG meticulously transforms your
application into a Graminized Docker image, encapsulating both your
application and the Gramine Library OS. The primary objective of the
Scaffolding project is to expedite the process of safeguarding applications
against malicious hosts.

To speed up the process, SCAG offers a single command - ``scag-quickstart``.
This tool will also guides user interactively through the entire process of "graminizing"
application, from setting up the project to building it, and finally running it.
For more advanced usage of the project, users are encouraged to refer to the documentation.


Note that the SCAG tool is split from core Gramine and is hosted here:
