Gramine Documentation
*********************

Gramine is a lightweight guest OS that's designed to run a single Linux application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can run applications in an isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a complete OS in a virtual machine, including guest customization, ease of porting to different host OSs, and process migration.

Gramine supports running Linux applications using the Intel Software Guard Extensions, or Intel SGX. For mor information, refer to the :doc:`sgx-intro` article.

This page provides an overview of this site. Each section is outlined below with a brief explanation and links to specific sections. This page mimics the table of contents in the left column. 

Gramine deployment options
------------------------------------
There are three deployment options for Gramineâ€”each option is described below. There is also one option to help develop Gramine.

Ready-made protected applications
=====================================
Confidential compute images are ready-made solutions for popular open source projects such as `PyTorch <https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib/tree/master/Curated-Apps/workloads/pytorch>`_ and `Redis <https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib/tree/master/Curated-Apps/workloads/redis>`_. These images enable you to customize your environment through interactive scripts. The result is an image that includes your specific machine-learning application, common dependencies, and a manifest file. 

.. note::  These confidential compute images only run on machines that support Intel SGX.

See the :doc:`curated-installation` article for more information.

Protect your container
============================
Docker images are used to run applications in the cloud. The Gramine Shielded Container tool transforms a Docker image into a graminized image that includes the Gramine Library OS and Intel SGX related information. It enables you to run an application on a Docker image and keep it protected. 

- :doc:`gsc-installation` - Get an overview of the installation process of a Gramine Shielded Container.
-  `Build a Gramine Docker image <https://gramine.readthedocs.io/projects/gsc/en/latest/>`_ - Build a Docker image that contains the Gramine functionality. 
-  `Download the Gramine Shielded Container tool <https://github.com/gramineproject/gsc>`_ - Protect the Docker image containing the application you want to protect. 


Protect your application
==========================

Use this option to protect an exiting application with Gramine. Little to no addition modification of your application is needed. 

These are the processes to follow protect your application with Gramine: 

- :doc:`Install Gramine<quickstart>` - Install Gramine from binaries on to the various supported versions of Ubuntu or RHEL 8. 
- :doc:`Set up the environment<environment-setup>` - Set up the Gramine environment to work with or without SGX and prepare a signing key.
- :doc:`Run a sample application<run-sample-application>` - Run a sample application to ensure your environment is running correctly. 


Develop Gramine
------------------------------------

This section describes how to develop Gramine. It contains instructions on how to install Gramine from binaries, install dependencies, set up debugging and other processes necessary for Gramine development.

- :doc:`Build Gramine from source files<devel/building>` - Build Gramine and ensure all the dependencies installed with proper drivers. This option requires a more work but allows you to choose build options. 
- :doc:`Set up Debugging<devel/debugging>` - Configure Gramine with Gnu Debugger (GDB) and setup compiling optimizations.
- :doc:`Implement a new system call<devel/new-syscall>` - Define the interface of the system call, add, import, and Implement new PAL calls if needed. 


Contribute to Gramine
------------------------------------
We encourage anyone who is interested to contribute to Gramine. We offer procedures and user groups that to help you get started. 

These articles contain helpful material for users who want to contribute to Gramine development. 

- :doc:`devel/contributing` - The Contributing to Gramine page outlines the procedures for performing pull requests, reviews, and regression tests. 

- :doc:`devel/onboarding` - This page describes the knowledge needed to efficiently contribute high-quality PRs to the Gramine project. This page also describes typical flows that Gramine developers should follow to make the process of PR review consistent for everyone involved. 

- :doc:`devel/DCO/index` - Affirm that the source code you will submit was originated by you and/or that you have permission to submit it to the Gramine project. 

- :doc:`devel/setup` - Learn the Emacs and Vim configurations used for Gramine. 

- :doc:`devel/coding-style` - This document describes coding conventions and formatting styles we use in Gramine. All newly committed code must conform to them to pass a review.

- :doc:`devel/howto-doc` - This section describes how the Gramine documentation is constructed and provides directions on how to contribute to it.


- `Gramine User Groups <https://groups.google.com/g/gramine-users>`_ - The Gramine user-groups page lists the user groups you can join to help you get up to speed with developing Gramine.

Resources
------------------------------------
The Gramine project provides resources to help you understand and develop it. The resources page contains a list of maintainers, users, and a glossary to help you with any questions you may have. 

- :doc:`management-team` - This page list the people managing the maintenance of Gramine
- :doc:`gramine-users` - See what companies are using Gramine for their confidential computing needs 
- :doc:`glossary` - Become familiar with the terms used for Gramine
