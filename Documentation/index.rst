Gramine documentation
*********************

Gramine is a lightweight guest OS that is designed to run a single Linux
application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can run applications in an
isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a complete OS in a
virtual machine, including guest customization, ease of porting to different
host OSes, and process migration.

Gramine supports running Linux applications using the :term:`Intel SGX <SGX>`
(Software Guard Extensions) technology. Gramine is able to run unmodified
applications inside SGX enclaves, without the toll of manually porting the
application to the SGX environment. Applications running inside the Gramine SGX
enclave become protected against a malicious host. For more information, refer
to the :doc:`sgx-intro` article.

This page provides an overview of this documentation. Each section is outlined
below with a brief explanation and links to specific sub-sections. This page
mimics the table of contents in the left-side menu.

Gramine deployment options
--------------------------

There are two deployment options for Gramine: protect your container and protect
your application. Each option has a dedicated section in the menu, and an
introduction is provided below.

Protect your container
======================

In this section, we describe how you can protect your Docker container using
Gramine Shielded Containers (GSC) and how you can use ready-made SGX images for
popular open source projects.

- **Gramine Shielded Containers**

  Docker images are used to run applications in the cloud. The Gramine Shielded
  Containers (GSC) tool transforms a base Docker image into a graminized Docker
  image that includes the Gramine Library OS and the Gramine-specific app
  configuration. It enables you to run an application in a Docker container and
  keep it protected against a malicious host. See the :doc:`gsc-installation`
  article for more information.

- **Ready-made SGX images**

  Users can create ready-made SGX Docker images with the help of the
  "Confidential Compute for X" project. This project provides an interactive
  script to transform base Docker images to Gramine-protected Docker images.
  See the :doc:`curated-installation` article for more information.

Protect your application
========================

Use this option to protect an existing application against a malicious host with
Gramine. Little to no additional modification of your application is usually
needed.

The following steps can be performed to protect your application with Gramine:

- :doc:`Install Gramine<installation>` - Install official Gramine packages from
  the repository of your Linux distribution.
- :doc:`Run a sample application<run-sample-application>` - Run a sample
  application to ensure your environment is configured correctly.

You can also check :doc:`Gramine tutorials<tutorials-index>`.

Configure Gramine
-----------------

To run an application with Gramine, the host platform must be correctly set up
first. Further, to achieve security and performance guarantees, Gramine must be
configured appropriately for each application.

- :doc:`Set up the host environment<sgx-setup>` - Set up the host environment
  and prepare a signing key.
- :doc:`Provide an application-specific configuration file<manifest-syntax>` -
  Gramine requires a so-called manifest file for each application.
- :doc:`Set up attestation<attestation>` -- If you intend to use remote
  attestation, you should set up attestation infrastructure.
- :doc:`Tune performance of application<performance>` - You may want to tune the
  performance of your application under Gramine.

Develop Gramine
---------------

This section describes how to develop Gramine. It contains instructions on how
to build and install Gramine from source, install dependencies, set up
debugging and other processes necessary for Gramine development.

- :doc:`Build Gramine from source files<devel/building>` - Build Gramine and
  ensure all the dependencies are installed.
- :doc:`Set up debugging<devel/debugging>` - Run Gramine with GDB.
- :doc:`Learn about packaging<devel/packaging>` - Package and distribute Gramine
  on different Linux distributions.
- :doc:`Use Python API<python/api>` - Use Python API provided by Gramine.

We also provide :doc:`manual pages for Gramine tools<manpages/index>`.

Contribute to Gramine
---------------------

We encourage anyone who is interested to contribute to Gramine. The below
articles contain helpful material for prospective contributors:

- :doc:`devel/contributing` - The Contributing to Gramine page outlines the
  procedures for performing pull requests, reviews, and regression tests.
- :doc:`devel/onboarding` - This page describes the knowledge needed to
  efficiently contribute high-quality PRs to the Gramine project. This page
  also describes typical flows that Gramine developers should follow to make
  the process of PR review consistent for everyone involved.
- :doc:`devel/setup` - Learn the Emacs and Vim configurations used for Gramine.
- :doc:`devel/coding-style` - This document describes coding conventions and
  formatting styles we use in Gramine. All newly committed code must conform
  to them to pass a review.
- :doc:`devel/howto-doc` - This section describes how the Gramine documentation
  is constructed and provides directions on how to contribute to it.
- :doc:`devel/DCO/index` - Affirm that the source code you will submit was
  originated by you and/or that you have permission to submit it to the Gramine
  project.

Resources
---------

The Gramine project provides resources to help you understand and develop it.
The resources page contains a description of features of Gramine, a list of
maintainers, a list of users of Gramine, introduction to the Intel SGX
technology and a glossary to help you with any questions you may have.

- :doc:`devel/features` -- This page has a comprehensive description of
  implemented and unimplemented features of Gramine, including the lists of
  available system calls and pseudo-files.
- :doc:`management-team` - This page lists maintainers of Gramine.
- :doc:`gramine-users` - See what companies use Gramine for their confidential
  computing needs.
- :doc:`sgx-intro` - Learn about the Intel SGX technology and software stack.
- :doc:`glossary` - Become familiar with the terms used in Gramine.
