Set up the Gramine environment
------------------------------

Gramine without SGX has no special requirements.

Gramine with SGX support requires several features from your system:

- The FSGSBASE feature of recent processors must be enabled in the Linux kernel.
- The Intel SGX driver must be built in the Linux kernel.
- The Intel PSW must be installed.
- The Intel DCAP must be installed if DCAP-based attestation should be used.

If your system doesn’t meet these requirements, please refer to more detailed
descriptions in :doc:`devel/building`.

Check for SGX compatibility
===========================

We supply a tool, :doc:`manpages/is-sgx-available` that checks the environment
for SGX compatibility.
Use this tool to check your hardware and system.
It’s installed together with the respective gramine package you previously
installed.

Prepare a signing key
=====================

.. highlight:: sh

Only for SGX, and if you haven’t already, enter the following::

    gramine-sgx-gen-private-key

This command generates an RSA 3072 key suitable for signing SGX enclaves and
stores it in :file:`{HOME}/.config/gramine/enclave-key.pem`.
Protect this key and do not disclose it to anyone.
