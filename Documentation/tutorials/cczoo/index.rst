Confidential Computing Zoo project
==================================

Confidential Computing Zoo (CCZoo) is a collection of code-ready reference
solutions. The CCZoo project provides developer guides and tutorials, in
order to facilitate the developers to build their own end-to-end Confidential
Computing solutions more easily. Some of the solutions are also checked on the
public cloud services, such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, AWS, Azure, etc.

The project is an Intel-backed effort. However, please note that CCZoo is
**not** an official part of Gramine Project.

Many solutions in CCZoo employ Gramine and its RA-TLS/Secret Provisioning
libraries. We encourage Gramine users to visit
https://github.com/intel/confidential-computing-zoo and explore the offerred
solutions. The corresponding documentation can be found at
https://cczoo.readthedocs.io.
