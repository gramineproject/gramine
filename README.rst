*A Linux-compatible Library OS for Multi-Process Applications*

What is Gramine?
================

Gramine (formerly called *Graphene*) is a |nbsp| lightweight library OS,
designed to run a single application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can
run applications in an isolated environment with benefits comparable to running
a |nbsp| complete OS in a |nbsp| virtual machine -- including guest
customization, ease of porting to different OSes, and process migration.

Gramine supports native, unmodified Linux binaries on any platform. Currently,
Gramine runs on Linux and Intel SGX enclaves on Linux platforms.

In untrusted cloud and edge deployments, there is a |nbsp| strong desire to
shield the whole application from rest of the infrastructure. Gramine supports
this “lift and shift” paradigm for bringing unmodified applications into
Confidential Computing with Intel SGX. Gramine can protect applications from a
|nbsp| malicious system stack with minimal porting effort.

Gramine is a growing project and we have a growing contributor and maintainer
community. The code and overall direction of the project are determined by a
diverse group of contributors, from universities, small and large companies, as
well as individuals. Our goal is to continue this growth in both contributions
and community adoption.

Note that the Gramine project was formerly known as Graphene. However, the name
"Graphene" was deemed too common, could be impossible to trademark, and collided
with several other software projects. Thus, a new name "Gramine" was chosen.
