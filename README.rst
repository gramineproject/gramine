*A Linux-compatible Library OS for Multi-Process Applications*

**NOTE:** We are in the middle of transitioning our buildsystem to Meson, and
the build procedures are changing. See `Building instructions
<https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html>`__ for an up-to-date
build tutorial.

What is Gramine?
================

Gramine (formerly called *Graphene*) is a |nbsp| lightweight library OS,
designed to run a single application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can
run applications in an isolated environment with benefits comparable to running
a |nbsp| complete OS in a |nbsp| virtual machine -- including guest
customization, ease of porting to different OSes, and process migration.

Gramine supports native, unmodified Linux binaries on any platform. Currently,
Gramine runs on Linux and Intel SGX enclaves on Linux platforms.

In untrusted cloud and edge deployments, there is a |nbsp| strong desire to
shield the whole application from rest of the infrastructure. Gramine supports
this “lift and shift” paradigm for bringing unmodified applications into
Confidential Computing with Intel SGX. Gramine can protect applications from a
|nbsp| malicious system stack with minimal porting effort.

Gramine is a growing project and we have a growing contributor and maintainer
community. The code and overall direction of the project are determined by a
diverse group of contributors, from universities, small and large companies, as
well as individuals. Our goal is to continue this growth in both contributions
and community adoption.

Note that the Gramine project was formerly known as Graphene. However, the name
"Graphene" was deemed too common, could be impossible to trademark, and collided
with several other software projects. Thus, a new name "Gramine" was chosen.

Release candidate version of Gramine (formerly Graphene) 1.2 available
======================================================================

Gramine has evolved a |nbsp| lot since our last major release. Over the last
few months, we have made significant updates to provide a |nbsp| stable version
that supports deploying key workloads with Intel SGX. We’ve rewritten major
subsystems, done a |nbsp| significant update to the build and packaging
scripts, extended test coverage, and improved the CI/CD process. We’ve reviewed
and hardened specific security aspects of Gramine, and increased stability for
long-running and heavy workloads.

Gramine also includes full SGX Attestation support, protected files support,
multi-process support with encrypted IPC, and support for the upstreamed SGX
driver for Linux. We’ve introduced a |nbsp| number of performance optimizations
for SGX, and provide mechanisms to more easily deploy in cloud environments
with full support for automatic Docker container integration using Gramine
Shielded Containers (GSC).

We have a |nbsp| growing set of well-tested applications including machine
learning frameworks, databases, webservers, and programming language
runtimes.

This version of Gramine is tagged 'v1.2-rc1'. We encourage you to try this out
with your workloads and let us know if you’re facing any issues. Please see
`the release page
<https://github.com/gramineproject/graphene/releases/tag/v1.2-rc1>`__ for release
notes and installation instructions.

While we have made significant progress, we are continuing to work towards
making Gramine better and adding support for more workloads. The items that we
are most immediately working on are tracked in `#1544
<https://github.com/gramineproject/graphene/issues/1544>`__.

In the meantime, we are also in the process of transitioning the Gramine
project to a |nbsp| new home within the Confidential Computing Consortium under
the Linux Foundation. In Q3 2021 we will provide more details on this, and we
expect the next version of Gramine to be released once this transition is
complete.
