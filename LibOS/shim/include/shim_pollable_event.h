/* TODO: once epoll is rewritten, change these to normal events with two states (set and not set),
 * remove `wait_pollable_event` and make all handles nonblocking. */
/*
 * These events have counting semaphore semantics:
 * - `set_pollable_event(e, n)` increases value of the semaphore by `n`,
 * - `wait_pollable_event(e)` decreases value by 1 (blocking if it's 0),
 * - `clear_pollable_event(e)` decreases value to 0 without blocking - this operation is not atomic.
 * Additionally `e->read_handle` can be passed to `DkStreamsWaitEvents` (which is actually the only
 * purpose these events exist for).
