/*
 * This file contains implementation of the "synthetic" filesystem. This filesystem handles
 * in-memory files (currently, only directories) created in the process of mounting a filesystem.
 *
 * For example, if the manifest specifies a mount at "/usr/bin", and "usr" does not exist, Gramine
 * will create synthetic directories for "/usr" and "/usr/bin". While "/usr/bin" will be immediately
 * shadowed by the mounted directory, "/usr" will remain visible for the user.
 *
 * Operations on synthetic files are handled by `synthetic_builtin_fs` defined below. It should be
 * possible to retrieve information about them (`stat`, `getdents` etc.), but not modify them in any
 * way.
