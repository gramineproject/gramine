/* Trusted files (TF) are integrity protected and transparently verified when accessed by Gramine
 * or by app running inside Gramine. For each file that requires authentication (specified in the
 * manifest as "sgx.trusted_files"), a SHA256 hash is generated and stored in the manifest, signed
 * and verified as part of the enclave's crypto measurement. When user opens such a file, Gramine
 * loads the whole file, calculates its SHA256 hash, and checks against the corresponding hash in
 * the manifest. If the hashes do not match, the file access will be rejected.
 *
 * During the generation of the SHA256 hash, a 128-bit hash (truncated SHA256) is also generated for
 * each chunk (of size TRUSTED_CHUNK_SIZE) in the file. The per-chunk hashes are used for partial
 * verification in future reads, to avoid re-verifying the whole file again or the need of caching
 * file contents.
