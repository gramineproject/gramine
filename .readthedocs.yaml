# The recent version of urllib3 (v2.0) only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+. However, the ReadTheDocs
# engine that we use for generating our web documentation by default uses older OpenSSL. The
# workaround is to pin a specific OS distro and Python version.
# See also https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/10290.
