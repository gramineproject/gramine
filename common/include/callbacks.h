 * Defines a set of callbacks that the common library expects from environment it is linked into.
 * Currently, the common library expects `libos_`-prefixed callbacks from LibOS, `pal_`-prefixed
 * callbacks from PAL, and not-prefixed callbacks from all other environments (e.g., PAL regression
 * tests and non-Gramine programs). This header aliases the actual callback implementations, i.e.,
 * `libos_abort()` is aliased as `abort()` for use by the common library.
 *
 * Strictly speaking, current Gramine doesn't need different callback names for LibOS, PAL and
 * other environments. We introduce this notation for the future change where LibOS and PAL will be
 * statically linked together in a single binary (thus, we want to avoid name collisions in
 * callbacks).
 *
 * All environments should implement `_log` and `_abort` callbacks, and can optionally implement
 * `describe_location`.
