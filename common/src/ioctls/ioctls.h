 * This feature implements the TOML syntax of the manifest entries used for deep-copying complex
 * nested objects out and inside the Gramine memory. This syntax is currently used for IOCTL
 * emulation and is generic enough to describe the most common memory layouts for deep copy of IOCTL
 * structs.
 *
 * We distinguish between Gramine memory and host memory. This distinction is only relevant for TEE
 * PALs. E.g. for Linux-SGX PAL, Gramine memory means in-SGX-enclave memory and host memory means
 * outside-SGX-enclave untrusted memory.
 *
 * The high-level description can be found in the "manifest syntax" documentation page.
 *
 * The following example describes the main implementation details:
 *
 *   struct pascal_str { uint8_t len; char str[]; };
 *   struct c_str { char str[]; };
 *   struct root { struct pascal_str* s1;
 *                 struct c_str* s2; uint64_t s2_buf_size;
 *                 int8_t x; int8_t y; };
 *
 *   alignas(128) struct root obj;
 *   ioctl(devfd, DEV_IOCTL_NUMBER, &obj);
 *
 * The example IOCTL takes as a third argument a pointer to an object of type `struct root` that
 * contains two pointers to other objects (pascal-style string and a C-style string) and embeds two
 * integers `x` and `y`. The two strings reside in separate memory regions in Gramine memory. Note
 * that the size of the allocated buffer for the C-style string is stored in the `s2_buf_size` field
 * of the root object. The `pascal_str` string is an input to the IOCTL, the `c_str` string and its
 * actual size `s2_buf_size` are the outputs of the IOCTL, and the integers `x` and `y` are also
 * outputs of the IOCTL. Also note that the root object is 128B-aligned (for illustration purposes).
 * This IOCTL could for example be used to convert a Pascal string into a C string (C string will be
 * truncated to user-specified `s2_buf_size` if greater than this limit), and find the indices of
 * the first occurrences of chars "x" and "y" in the Pascal string.
 *
 * The corresponding manifest entries describing these structs look like this:
 *
 *   sys.ioctl_structs.root = [
 *     { alignment = 128, ptr = [
 *                            { name = "pascal-str-len", size = 1, direction = "out" },
 *                            { name = "pascal-str", size = "pascal-str-len", direction = "out"}
 *                        ] },
 *     { ptr = [
 *           { name = "c-str", size = "c-buf-size", direction = "in" }
 *       ] },
 *     { name = "c-buf-size", size = 8, direction = "inout" },
 *     { size = 2, direction = "in" }  # x and y fields
 *   ]
 *
 *   sys.allowed_ioctls = [
 *     { request_code = <DEV_IOCTL_NUMER>, struct = "root" }
 *   ]
 *
 * The current TOML syntax has the following rules/limitations:
 *
 *  1. Each separate memory region is represented as a TOML array (`[]`).
 *  2. Each sub-region of one memory region is represented as a TOML table (`{}`).
 *  3. Each sub-region may be a pointer (`ptr`) to another memory region. In this case, the value of
 *     `ptr` is a TOML-array representation of that other memory region or a TOML string with the
 *     name of another memory region. The `ptr` sub-region always has size of 8B (assuming x86-64)
 *     and doesn't have an in/out direction. The `array_len` field specifies the number of adjacent
 *     memory regions that this pointer points to (i.e. the length of the array).
 *  4. Sub-regions can be fixed-size (like the last sub-region containing two bytes `x` and `y`) or
 *     can be flexible-size (like the two strings). In the latter case, the `size` field contains a
 *     name of a sub-region where the actual size is stored. Note that this referenced sub-region
 *     must come *before* (in the Breadth-First-Search sense) the sub-region with such flexible-size
 *     `size` -- TOML representations of typical IOCTL structs always have the size specifier in a
 *     sub-region found before the buffer sub-region, either in the same memory region (e.g. as in
 *     flexible array members in C) or in the "outer" memory region (e.g. the size specifier is
 *     located in the root memory region and the buffer is located in the nested memory region).
 *     This is a limitation of the current parser and could be removed in the future, if need
 *     arises.
 *  5. Sub-regions that store the size of another sub-region must be less than or equal to 8 bytes
 *     in size.
 *  6. Sub-regions may have a name for ease of identification; this is required for "size" /
 *     "array_len" sub-regions but may be omitted for all other kinds of sub-regions.
 *  7. Sub-regions may have one of the four directions: "out" to copy contents of the sub-region out
 *     of Gramine memory to host memory, "in" to copy from host memory into Gramine memory, "inout"
 *     to copy in both directions, "none" to not copy at all (useful for e.g. padding).  Note that
 *     pointer sub-regions do not have a direction (their values are unconditionally rewired so as
 *     to point to the corresponding region in host memory).
 *  8. The first sub-region (and only the first!) may specify the alignment of the memory region.
 *  9. The total size of a sub-region is calculated as `size * unit + adjustment`. By default `unit`
 *     is 1 byte and `adjustment` is 0. Note that `adjustment` may be a negative number.
 *
 * The diagram below shows how this complex object is copied from Gramine memory (left side) to
 * host memory (right side). MR stands for "memory region", SR stands for "sub-region". Note how
 * Gramine-memory pointers are copied and rewired to point to host-memory regions.
