# Redis manifest file example

################################## GRAMINE ####################################

# PAL entrypoint (points to the LibOS layer library of Gramine). There is
# currently only one implementation, so it is always set to libsysdb.so.
loader.entrypoint = "file:{{ gramine.libos }}"

# Entrypoint binary which Gramine invokes.
libos.entrypoint = "/redis-server"

# Verbosity of Gramine debug log (none/error/warning/debug/trace/all). Note
# that GRAMINE_LOG_LEVEL macro is expanded in the Makefile as part of the
# building process: the default is "error" for non-debug builds, and "debug"
# for debug builds.
loader.log_level = "{{ log_level }}"

################################# ARGUMENTS ###################################

# Hardcode application arguments. See README for explanations.
loader.argv = ["redis-server", "--save", ""]

################################# ENV VARS ####################################

# Specify paths to search for libraries. The usual LD_LIBRARY_PATH syntax
# applies. Paths must be in-Gramine visible paths, not host paths (i.e.,
# paths must be taken from fs.mounts[...].path, not fs.mounts[...].uri).
#
# In case of Redis:
# - /lib is searched for Glibc libraries (ld, libc, libpthread)
loader.env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/lib"

################################## SIGNALS ####################################

# Allow for injecting SIGTERM signal from the host. Without this option,
# pressing `Ctrl + C` wouldn't terminate Redis.
sys.enable_sigterm_injection = true

################################# MOUNT FS ####################################

# General notes:
# - All mount points are mounted using the default 'chroot' type.
# - `path`: names of directories and files in Gramine environment; they may be
#           arbitrary but here we mostly reuse host URIs for simplicity (except
#           for the first `/lib` mount point).
# - `uri`:  names of directories and files on the host, somewhat confusingly
#           prepended by the 'file:' keyword.

fs.mounts = [
  # Mount on-host directory to Gramine glibc/runtime libraries (in 'uri') into
  # in-Gramine visible directory /lib (in 'path').
  { path = "/lib", uri = "file:{{ gramine.runtimedir() }}" },

  # Mount redis-server executable (located in the current directory) under the
  # in-Gramine visible root directory.
  { path = "/redis-server", uri = "file:redis-server" },
]

############################### SGX: GENERAL ##################################

# Create a debug SGX enclave (with SIGSTRUCT.ATTRIBUTES.DEBUG bit set to 1).
# This allows to debug Gramine with the application using GDB, read perf
# counters and enable SGX statistics. Note that this option is *insecure*!
sgx.debug = true

# Set enclave size (somewhat arbitrarily) to 1024MB. Recall that SGX v1 requires
# to specify enclave size at enclave creation time. If Redis exhausts these
# 1024MB then it will start failing with random errors. Greater enclave sizes
# result in longer startup times, smaller enclave sizes are not enough for
# typical Redis workloads.
sgx.enclave_size = "1024M"

# Set maximum number of in-enclave threads (somewhat arbitrarily) to 8. Recall
# that SGX v1 requires to specify the maximum number of simultaneous threads at
# enclave creation time.
#
# Note that internally Gramine may spawn two additional threads, one for IPC
# and one for asynchronous events/alarms. Redis is technically single-threaded
# but spawns couple additional threads to do background bookkeeping. Therefore,
# specifying '8' allows to run a maximum of 6 Redis threads which is enough.
sgx.max_threads = 8

# Redis executable is typically a PIE (Position Independent Executable) on most
# modern OS distros (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04). However, on some OS distros (notably,
# CentOS), Redis executable is built as non-PIE. We mark Redis as a non-PIE
# binary unconditionally -- this makes it work on CentOS and doesn't hurt on
# Ubuntu. (Note that non-SGX Gramine correctly distinguishes between PIE and
# non-PIE binaries, but for SGX we need to prearrange enclave memory layout,
# hence the below option.)
sgx.nonpie_binary = true

############################# SGX: TRUSTED FILES ###############################

# Specify all files used by Redis and its dependencies (including all libraries
# which can be loaded at runtime via dlopen), as well as other static read-only
# files (like configuration files).
#
# The paths to files are on-host paths. These files will be searched for in
# in-Gramine visible paths according to mount points above.
#
# As part of the build process, Gramine-SGX script (`gramine-sgx-sign`) finds
# each specified file, measures its hash, and adds it to the manifest entry for
# that file (converting each entry to a table with "uri" and "sha256" keys).
# Note that this happens on the developer machine or a build server. If a
# directory is specified in the list below, then this directory is recursively
# traversed and each found file is processed as described above.
#
# At runtime, during loading of each "trusted file", Gramine-SGX measures its
# hash and compares with the "sha256" value in the corresponding manifest entry.
# If hashes match, this file is trusted and allowed to be loaded and used. Note
# that this happens on the deployment machine.
sgx.trusted_files = [
  "file:{{ gramine.libos }}",
  "file:redis-server",
  "file:{{ gramine.runtimedir() }}/",
]
