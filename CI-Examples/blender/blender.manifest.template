# INSECURE! These 3 lines are insecure by design and should never be used in production environments.
# There is a lot of files that Blender uses (e.g. bundled Python) and listing them here would
# be counter productive, as they may change between Blender releases and this is just a testing
# manifest.
# Additionally, Blender scenes could allow for code execution (e.g. via bundled scripts), so
# running untrusted scenes should not be allowed. This can be achieved for example by adding scenes
# to trusted files or uploading them to a running and attested enclave via secured connection.
