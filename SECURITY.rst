Reporting Security Issues
=========================

The Gramine team and community take security bugs in Gramine seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security issues to security@gramineproject.io.

Please note that the Gramine team analyzes security bugs only on the current
``master`` branch. This implies that you must reproduce the bug on master before
reporting.

The Gramine team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your
report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you
informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies (e.g., in mbedTLS) to the
person or team maintaining that dependency.
